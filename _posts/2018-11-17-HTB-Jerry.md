title: Jerry - My First Hack The Box Ownage
---
## Hack The Box

I "received" my [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) invite code over the summer but I never really got into it. Recently I decided to see what this whole pen-testing thing was about and put in some work to try and hack a box. I went for Jerry because it had a difficulty of 2.9/10 and had over 10,000 system and user owns (solves).

## Reconnaissance

### Nmap Scan

Obviously the first thing to do is see what ports are open and what services are listening on those ports. The final scan I ran was `nmap -On jerry.scan -Pn -sV jerry.htb`.

* `-On` saves the output to the file `jerry.scan` in Nmap's default output so that I can reference it later if needed. I do this for every box I scan.
* `-Pn` tells Nmap to treat hosts as if they're online. Default behavior is to do some host discovery such as pinging the IP address to make sure the machine is up before trying to scan it. This box did not respond to Nmap's ping probes so the scan will exit without this argument.
* `-sV` is an attempt to determine services and versions listening on an open port. This gives more useful information than just HTTP listening on port 80.
* `jerry.htb` is how the box is defined in my `/etc/hosts` file so that I can keep track of machines without looking for their IP address.

Thank God it's HTTP. That's the kind of stuff I'm most comfortable with.

### The Website

We can tell it's running Apache Tomcat from the Nmap scan, but maybe the webpage can tell us more.

Alright it looks like a default installation. The Manager App button looks like it could get us somewhere. It's behind Basic Auth and anytime I see a username/password form I automatically put in `test/test` to see what will happen.

Maybe we should try `tomcat/s3cret`.

And we're in.

## Exploitation

I don't know a whole lot about pen-testing but I have heard Apache Tomcat and Metasploit in the same sentence before. A quick search for `msf apache tomcat` brings up the [exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy) module.
