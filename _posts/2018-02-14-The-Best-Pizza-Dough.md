title: The Best Pizza Dough Recipe
---
This pizza dough has been the best so far in my quest for the perfect crust.

### Ingredients
<ul>
    <li>2 1/4 tsp. Dry Active Yeast</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. Brown Sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Warm Water</li>
    <li>1 tsp. Salt</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. Olive Oil</li>
    <li>3 1/3 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
</ul>

### Directions
<ol>
Note: Dough will take an hour to rise. Preheat to 500F sometime afterwards depending on how long your oven takes to heat up.
    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and brown sugar in the warm water, let sit for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir the salt and oil into the solution. Mix in 2 1/2 cups of the flour.</li>
    <li>Mix in more flour if dough is still too sticky. Turn dough onto well-floured surface. Knead in more flour until dough is no longer sticky.</li>
    <li>Place in a bowl with the surface coated in oil. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1-1.5 hours.</li>
    <li>Fold down to form a tight ball. Let sit a minute before rolling out.</li>
    <ul><li>If baking in a pan rather than on a stone, let sit another 15 minutes before topping and baking.</li></ul> 
    <li>Bake until cheese and crust start to brown. About 10-20 minutes depending on heat and size of pizza.</li>
</ol>
