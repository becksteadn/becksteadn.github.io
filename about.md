I am a security analyst with a mind for automation. I love pushing the limits of the AWS free tier and sometimes catch interesting activity in my honeypots. This blog contains a lot of small tidbits that I learn from work, projects, and CTFs. Don't expect any hot takes or zero days but don't rule them out either.


Presentation slides available on the [presentations page](/resources).
